Quickstarts also available for: [Java](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-java-code-snippets), [.NET](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-dotnet-code-snippets), [Node.js](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-node-code-snippets), [PHP](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-php-code-snippets), [Python](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-python-code-snippets)

The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused
on one goal. For example, sending an SMS, handling an incoming SMS webhook,
making a Text to Speech call.

*Note: The code snippets inside this repository are best viewed within the context of the [Vonage API Developer Platform](https://developer.nexmo.com). Within the platform each snippet is shown with its dependency requirements and installation instructions. For example, see the [Connect Callers into a Conference Ruby Code Snippet](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/code-snippets/connect-callers-into-a-conference/ruby).*

## Setup

To use this sample you will first need a [Vonage API account][sign-up]. Then rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples you will need to [buy a number][buy-number].

## Running the Examples

Run the examples using the following replacing `/path/to/example.rb` with a path
to a real file:

```sh
ruby /path/to/example.rb
```
